        <h3>Web Design</h3>

        <p>
          I strongly recommend checking out the online
          <a
            href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/"
            >Responsive Web Design course</a
          >
          from FreeCodeCamp and its learner-friendly
          <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/">Community Forum</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, FreeCodeCamp offers a recognised certification (also for
          free!) that will look impressive on your CV or Linkedin profile.
        </p>

        <p>
          You have already covered about 80% of the material in this course, so
          you should be able to complete it in a few weeks.
        </p>

        <h3>Graphic Design</h3>

        <p>
          Want to learn about Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe
          Photoshop? Then this is the course and certification for you:
        </p>

        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.ibat.ie/courses/graphic-design-desktop-publishing-diploma.html"
            >IBAT Graphic Design &amp; Desktop Publishing Diploma</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          This part-time course concentrates on the fundamentals of the above
          Adobe platforms essential for people in creative, marketing and
          communications roles.
        </p>

        <h3>Full Stack Development Diploma</h3>

        <p>
          If you want to move forward into developing web and mobile apps, then
          you will be interested in this course:
        </p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <h3>Coursera and Edx</h3>

        <p>
          These are two (rival) networks of mostly US universities that offer a wide
          range of free online courses. However, you need to pay for the
          certification.
        </p>

        <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
