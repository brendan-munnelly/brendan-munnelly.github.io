		<h2>Spiral TV series</h2>

		<p>Spiral is a French television police procedural and legal drama series following the work and the private lives of Paris police officers and lawyers and judges at the Palais de Justice, Paris. It was created by Alexandra Clert for the TV production company Son et Lumière. The first series of eight episodes started broadcast on Canal+ in France in December 2005.</p>

		<h3>Title</h3>
		<p>The original French title is <i>Engrenages</i>. This word carries various meanings in French. Although it literally translates as either "gears" or "gearing", it is also used in various idioms and the official translation of the title picks up the phrase "a spiral of violence" (<i>engrenage de violence</i>), though it also carries overtones of "getting caught up in the works" (<i>mettre un doigt dans l'engrenage</i>), "getting some grit in the works" (<i>un grain de sable dans l'engrenage</i>) and even "the cycle of drug abuse" (<i>l'engrenage de la drogue</i>), or "gearing" in the sense of "intensification".</p>

		<h3>Awards</h3>
		<p>Spiral has received wide-ranging critical acclaim throughout its run, and has been nominated and won several awards. It has been nominated at the Globes de Cristal Awards four times, winning once. It was also nominated for Best Drama at the BAFTA Awards, and it won the 2015 International Emmy Award for Best Series.</p>
